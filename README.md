# diskmodels
Calculate disk models for AGN. Currently only simple Î±-disk models are implemented (e.g. [Shakura and Sunyaev 1973](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973A%26A....24..337S/abstract)). 

If you would like to use tabluated opacities (from https://github.com/zhuzh1983/combined-opacity), then please clone this repository using 
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ajdittmann/diskmodels.git`. If you would like to use a simple Kramers' opacity, or use other opacity tables,
one can simply use `git clone https://github.com/ajdittmann/diskmodels.git`.
